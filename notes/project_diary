- LAMP server installation was done following this guide: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/raspberry-pi-apache-mysql-php-lamp-server/
- Apache2 was installed on the raspberry pi. Accessible via 192.160.1.100:80. Seems to work without disturbing the PiHole server.
- There are some issues with the PiHole webpage. The admin panel is accessible over 192.168.1.100/admin, but the welcome page on 192.168.1.100 is replaced
    but the apache2 webpage.    
- Webpage root is currently in /var/www/html
- PHP was installed.
- Created a folder in ./greenhouse that the index page for the data logger is in. The PiHole is now accessible again on 192.168.1.100, and the greenhouse index page on 
    192.168.1.100/greenhouse.
- Installed MySQL, MariaDB, and phpMyAdmin. Password for MariaDB is the standard prefix and the domain "MariaDB". Password for "phpmyadmin" uses the same prefix.
- Apache2 had som issues when it listened on port 80. Probably caused by the PiHole. Changed Apache2 port to 8080 in /etc/apache2/ports.conf.
- Had some issues displaying the phpmyadmin page. Had to install extra libraries (libapache2-mod-php) for apache2 to solve it.
- Note to self: make sure that you change 'your_password' in the instruction to the _actual_ password...
- phpmyadmin now works using login 'admin' and the usual prefix password for that domain.

- Next step: Set up the ESP32 to send some data to the database. Read up on ground humidity sensors.

- ESP32 was set up following this guide: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-esp8266-raspberry-pi-lamp-server/
- Created the database and table for sensor data. Right now it is identical to the one in the guide. A custom one will be made later.
- Set up the PHP scripts.

- Set up password header file.
- Set up Si7021 sensor for temp and humdidity readings.
- Wrote pretty much all the remaining code that goes on the ESP32.
- Noticed that there already is a timestamp on all the readings in the database. So I can remove the NTP server from the ESP.

- Measured the deep sleep power consumption. Was about 0.4 mA.
- Finalised the pod and mounted the whole thing in the greenhouse. Seems to work!
- Projekt pretty much done! Data will probaby be visualized in Excel for now, as front end
programming isn't a project that I'm looking forward too.

- TODO: add the .php files to the repository. Right now they are only on the LAMP server.
- TODO: create the interactive webpage.
- TODO: make website public??

- DONE: Meassure the deep sleep power consumption. Seems like wifi, bt, and adc might have to be manually turned off?
- DONE: write code for real sensor readings and set up the correct database.
- DONE: Tidy up the finished code.
- DONE: figure out how hibernation and SD card works on the esp. https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-data-logging-temperature-to-microsd-card/
- DONE: read the passwords from a file on the LAMP server, such that they are not uploaded to github.
- DONE: Change api key in the php script.
