- Apache2 was installed on the raspberry pi. Accessible via 192.160.1.100:80. Seems to work without disturbing the PiHole server.
- There are some issues with the PiHole webpage. The admin panel is accessible over 192.168.1.100/admin, but the welcome page on 192.168.1.100 is replaced
    but the apache2 webpage.    
- Webpage root is currently in /var/www/html
- PHP was installed.
- Created a folder in ./greenhouse that the index page for the data logger is in. The PiHole is now accessible again on 192.168.1.100, and the greenhouse index page on 
    192.168.1.100/greenhouse.
